Dashboard Summary:
Title: Visualizing the Impact of Covid-19 in San Diego:
This interactive dashboard utilizes the Adaptive Choropleth Mapper (ACM) library to visualize and analyze the impact of Covid-19 in San Diego. The data for visualization is sourced from the "SD_Confirmed_Vaccine_Final_v5.csv" dataset, containing crucial variables such as geo IDs, confirmed cases, vaccination rates, and other Covid-19 metrics. Additionally, geographical coordinates of San Diego places are loaded from the "SanDiego_Zip_COVID.shp" shapefile using the geospatial library, Geopandas.
The dashboard's primary objective is to provide an insightful analysis of Covid-19 trends and vaccination rates across different zip codes in San Diego. It offers a user-friendly interface with multiple linked charts to facilitate data exploration and comparison. The dashboard comprises two side-by-side choropleth maps, a bar chart, and temporal line charts that enable users to gain a comprehensive understanding of the pandemic's impact on various regions.
